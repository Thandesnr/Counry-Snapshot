# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This project aims to analyze a dataset and identify the most important products (or items) based on certain criteria, such as sales, customer preferences, or other relevant metrics. By applying machine learning techniques, the goal is to generate insights into which products have the highest impact, allowing for data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, and text processing to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying important features that influence product importance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of regression and classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to rank and predict the most important products.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like RÂ², Accuracy, and Mean Squared Error to evaluate model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating visualizations to highlight key product insights using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Dash Web Application**: A user-friendly interface to display the results interactively and explore the most important products.

## Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. Identify and rank the most important products based on given data and features.
2. Provide a data-driven approach to decision-making in product selection, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
3. Visualize the insights for better understanding and actionable results.
