# German Credit Bank Data - EDA & Statistical Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical analysis** on the German Credit Bank dataset. The system focuses on credit analysis by examining the relationship between credit amounts and various factors like housing types, along with conducting statistical tests such as ANOVA.

## Key Features:
- **ANOVA Test**: Tests for significant differences in credit amounts between different housing types (free, own, rent).
- **Data Visualization**: Provides interactive visualizations to explore the dataset, including pairplots and heatmaps.
- **Credit Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis on credit data to identify patterns and significant differences.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict creditworthiness based on the dataset.

## Features:
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Allows users to select target variables and feature variables to visualize using dropdown menus.
- **Visualization Options**: Choose between different visualization types, such as pairplots for feature comparisons or correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.
- **ANOVA Hypothesis Testing**: Performs an ANOVA test to check if there is a significant difference in credit amounts based on housing type.
  
These features automate the analysis process, helping to uncover patterns in the credit data and assess the relationship between housing types and credit amounts.
